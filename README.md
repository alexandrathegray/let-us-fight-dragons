# let-us-fight-dragons
A repository for my attempted at creating an AR component for my dungeons and dragons experience
I think that augmented reality could be really fun and useful in a fantasy (or any genre) role playing game setting.  I am imagining cards that are connected to certain objects and when you view them through a ar enabled device then you could see a floating 3d model of that object or thing.  Could have an interaction potential where stats or contents could be brought up.
